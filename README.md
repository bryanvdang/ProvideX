Meaning of the colors:

- Bright green, are sub routines, Line Labels

- Teal are variables, string variables have a dollar sign at the end

- Yellow: text that is hardcoded

- Red are syntax things

- White are directives/functions

- ! , dark teal is the comment
---
Variables:
- String variables end in $
- An empty string will be set to ""
- Numeric variables do not end in $
- A numeric value that is not set will be a 0 which is the same as not set
- No need to explicitly declare variables before using them

There are no Booleans but you can simulate booleans variables. 
- Integers: 0 for false or 1 for true
- Strings: "Y"/"N" or "T"/"F"
---
Commands:
- '/' list everything same as typing 'list'
- Display a line $ls + line number
- Renumber the lines $renumber
- Save $save "file path"
- Display directories $?pfx

LS Command:
- Command $ls "line number", b
- Will take you to the line number in the code
- Command to take you to a line label until it reaches a return. 'b' for block. List out the block
$ ls "line label name", b


How to create a program that prints string text and a numeric value

Line Labels and Subroutines:

GOSUB:
- Good to use. Try to use instead of using lines. Using lines doesn't tell you what the code does but at least with line labels you can kind of get an idea of what is happening
- Maintaining the flow of code, "let's do something outside of the current code block", and keeps code clean to section it off.
- Gives you an easy way to end a function early. If you look at line 130, it reads but if there is an error, skip whatever is left (skip 140) and go straight to the return. This logic is usually used for validation. If you get data validate it, if it fails then hit the return.

GOTO:
- frowned upon, just jumps around code (Bad practice)
- <img width="494" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3611480f-3c4f-42c7-b185-d01e759d716c" />
This code is a sub routine, where we localize the variables,
- We set the file
- We're going to open the file we just looked at
- We're going to read from it
- Close it, then print something out.
- Nothing should be bleeding out

If you a subroutine to return something, don't localize the variable.

---
LOCAL Statements:
If you don't use LOCAL, you are expecting it to be set.

When going through files, its better to use for loops and while loops and we commonly use select loops because select loops tie directly into files. A select loop would loop through this file. 

You can assign variables in the LOCAL variables when its initialized.

- LOCAL statements can protect values from being changed while in a GOSUB or PERFORM
- LOCAL name$
This will keep the variable of name$ to its current state, but once the block has finished, it will reset the value to its original state.
---
PERFORMS are exactly the same as a subsroutine aka gosub but Performs are in a different program
<img width="180" height="17" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc4be501-7d98-4379-a5b2-59c44b89a447" />
- Similar to a GOSUB but in a different program
- The quotes need the program name followed by the gosub. It has to be a gosub and not a line number
- Perform will stop at a return but if there's a GOTO, the GOTO will bypass the return until its done running the code in the GOTO. Then it will return to the stack it was at before.

---
CALLS are like performs but will localize everything that's not passed into it.
- Similar to a perform but has parameters
- Allows for default values
- They are more similar to a function
- You only have to be explicit in parameters. If you're passing in a string, you have to make sure the accepting parameters is set to a string as well
- Calls require 'exit' to get out of the program while subroutines and performs require returns
- Adding parenthese is a way to prevent the variable from being changed.
- <img width="307" height="14" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab61f3da-82ca-4516-b751-6ab9331c8001" />
-Good because they help you containerize code, that can be globally used across the system, protects variables so you don't have to create a long list of localization.
-Downside side is it gets difficult when it involves multiple file channels.

Be sure to put an 'END' at the end of the GOSUB(s)

Use Line labels when using GOSUBs so you don't lose your line number and its cleaner.

Functions:
- Cvs (similar to stp, stripping spaces, manipulating the contents of the spacing the string you pass in). CVS is more of a binary function. You send it parameter 1, which is strip deleting, parameter 2 is strip the trailing, parameter 3 is strip deleting.
    - Lets you utilize control characters, so if a third party has junk on a string you don't want, you can convert it to spaces.
- Stp (stp is the basic version, you're stripping the front, the back, you can even strip certain characters out of the string.

- Pad
    - Padding, checking to see if a value is a certain length
- Tbl
    - Table statement, similar to a ternary. In a table function, you can have multiple results. The first parameter in your table statement, is the numeric value of what you want to happen.
In this example is, the string we give it is "W". It will iterate over the string "DWM". First case, if it can't find anything it will return "???", if the string was D it would return Daily, W Weekly, or M monthly. In our example we have W so it returns weekly

    - In this example should print "one" since its in the Oneth position, if x was 4, it would error stating it doesn't exist within the range (#41)
    - <img width="374" height="128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c70b12e-70d4-46b2-9c59-9d793ea16ff9" />
    - Char replacement must have matching length
        - <img width="483" height="153" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea264892-951d-4f30-9ce3-1e1ad985904a" />
- Cse
    - Case statement within a function instead of a switch case
- Not
    - Will take the not of the value
- Nul
    - Tell you if itâ€™s a null or not (if its empty)
    - A value with 6 spaces is also null
    - Use to check if something is actually being set

- Num
    - Taking the number of something
    - <img width="353" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1cf1d5-3584-4c73-9a9e-feed4cc974c8" />
- Pos
    -What's the position of this value compared to this other value and will return a numeric value
- Sub
    - Substitute text. Replace certain characters within this string. Change the 'e's to 'o's. Something of that nature
- Ucs
    - Upper case. Also a lcs for lower case
- Str
    - Will see a lot. Practically take the string value of this number
	- Has lots of formatting masks. Use for currency or decimal
- Int
    - Not used too much but it takes the integer of a number<img width="583" height="257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f4b50ff-1305-4ad5-93a3-dcaec5f67faa" />

Arithmetic:
- <>, = 	not equals to	Not equal to, equal to
- +,-,*,/ 	Add, Minus, Multiply, Divide
- ++,--		Increment, Decrement
- <, >		Less than, greater than

---
Select Loop:

- This example (line 90) is saying, go select, grab these values, from this file channel, we're going to force it to start at the beginning and then we're going to keep going until we hit the end $FF$ because we don't usually store hex values in your key structure but $FF$ is a way to force it to the end. This will print values 1 through 30.
